## Agnikul
{{< featuredImage >}}
"Agnikul” is a derivative of the Sanskrit word - “Gurukul” and it could be interpreted to mean “a place where people learn to use fire”. They are a group of enthusiasts, rocket scientists, engineers, programmers, lawyers, and more.

First we will see little bit of information of 3D printer.

## 3D Printer
![3D Printer](/images/posts/3d_printer.jpg)
3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model. The term "3D printing" can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused together), typically layer by layer.

### What is 3D Printer?
3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object. 3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.

### How does 3D Printer works?

3D printing also called additive manufacturing can be thought has creative object using successive addition. 3D printer usually works by printing a layer over a previous printed layer and repeating the task till the objective is completed. Just like 2D printers, 3D printers also come equipped with different techniques to achieve the same task. Each having it's own advantages. FDM method being the most widely used, achieves the printing task by melting a filament and tracing a pre determined path with the extruder and then rising the extruder and then tracing the next path over the previous one.

Bringing Space Within Everyone's Reach
Going to space shouldn’t be the hardest part of utilizing, living in or working from space. So, why not design & build a product that makes the earth-to-space journey as simple, as quick and as affordable as possible?

### Agnibaan is a highly customizable, 2 stage launch vehicle.
Capable of taking upto 100 kg to orbits around 700 km high, Agnibaan can access both low and high inclination orbits and is completely mobile - designed for accessing more than 10 launchports.


Driven by LOX/Kerosene engines in all its stages, Agnibaan is configurable by the customer. Yes, Agnibaan doesn’t fly with the same number of engines all the time. The mission, the satellite and the launchport itself would decide how many engines go on the first stage.
