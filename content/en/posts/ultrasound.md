## Ultrasound

An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture (also known as a sonogram) of organs, tissues, and other structures inside the body. Unlike x-rays, ultrasounds don't use any radiation.

### What is Ultrasound?

Ultrasound is sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound is not different from "normal" sound in its physical properties, except that humans cannot hear it. This limit varies from person to person and is approximately 20 kilohertz in healthy young adults. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz. Ultrasound is used in many different fields. Ultrasonic devices are used to detect objects and measure distances. Ultrasound imaging or sonography is often used in medicine. In the nondestructive testing of products and structures, ultrasound is used to detect invisible flaws. Industrially, ultrasound is used for cleaning, mixing, and accelerating chemical processes. Animals such as bats and porpoises use ultrasound for locating prey and obstacles.

### How Ultrasound Works?

Ultrasound equipment detects sounds within ultra-high frequency ranges and transforms those sounds to a form that can be interpreted by a technician. Many times ultrasound is plotted to show how intensity measured in dB varies across frequencies, allowing a particular frequency to become the focus of ultrasound investigation. 

Filters that are part of the ultrasound equipment allow a technician to tune out other sounds that are not related to the investigation or troubleshooting process. And because sound is directional it is possible to pinpoint the exact location of a particular ultrasound source.

In addition to visual plots of intensity versus frequency, some types of ultrasound equipment can transform ultrasounds into a range that can be detected by human hearing. In such situations, a technician can wear a set of headphones to essentially “hear” the sounds and learn to recognize sounds for different electromechanical conditions.

### What is an ultrasound used for?

Ultrasound imaging uses sound waves to produce pictures of the inside of the body. It is used to help diagnose the causes of pain, swelling and infection in the body's internal organs and to examine a baby in pregnant women and the brain and hips in infants also not that ultrasound is used in industry sector to catch leakage, check crack, wealding and even divers who goes in oceans for find trasure, boats etc.

### Why Ultrasound Works?
So here is where things get interesting: when most industrial machines begin to approach a failure mode, the onset of the defect behind that failure mode results in high-frequency sounds being emitted. These sounds are usually the result of one of three things:

Increased friction (e.g., a bearing that is about to fail)
Impacting (e.g., cavitation in a hydraulic pump)
Turbulence (e.g., a vacuum leak, the effect of electrical discharge on air)
Each of these phenomena (friction, impact, turbulence) has its own ultrasound signature that is detectable with the right equipment in the hands of a trained technician.


### Applications for Ultrasound
Here is a list with some of the more common applications for ultrasound in an industrial setting:

- Valve bypass
- Vacuum leak detection
- Leak surveys
- Compressed air leak management
- Complex gearbox fault analysis
- Slow-speed bearing monitoring and analysis
- Monitoring the condition of bearings
- On-condition lubrication of bearings
- Cavitation detection in pumps
- Steam trap testing
- Steam systems management
- Tightness testing of non-pressurized volume
- Electrical systems inspection
- Heat exchanger (shell and tube) testing
- Detect tank and pipe wall thickness
- Evaluate fluid flow

### Benefits of Ultrasound in an Industrial Environment
Here are some key reasons why ultrasound works so well in industrial environments:

1. It is easy to learn and easy to use
2. It is non-contact 
3. It cannot cause damage to your equipment and assets
4. It can performed while the system is online
5. It is very versatile (i.e., can be used for mechanical and electrical systems)
6. Used correctly, it can pinpoint the location of problems
7. It is quick and effective means of inspection and ongoing monitoring
